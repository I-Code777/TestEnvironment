# Test Project for VS Code and GitHub Features

This repository is a simple project used to test features between **Visual Studio Code** and **GitHub**. It is primarily a personal project to help me get more familiar with using these platforms and their associated tools.

## Purpose

- Experimenting with basic version control using Git and GitHub.
- Exploring Visual Studio Code features like extensions, settings, and integrations.
- Learning the process of pushing, pulling, and managing repositories on GitHub.

## Usage

This project doesn't have any specific functionality beyond testing the integration between **VS Code** and **GitHub**. Feel free to check out the code and observe my learning process as I continue to experiment.
